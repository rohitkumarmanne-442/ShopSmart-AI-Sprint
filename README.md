# ShopSmart AI: Customer Segmentation Engine - Sprint Planning

## Project Overview

The Customer Segmentation Engine is a core component of the ShopSmart AI targeted advertising system. It analyzes customer shopping patterns to identify distinct customer groups based on behavior, preferences, and purchasing habits. This engine will enable the grocery store to create personalized marketing campaigns tailored to specific customer segments, increasing engagement and conversion rates. The segmentation will adapt over time as new shopping data becomes available, allowing for increasingly personalized targeting.

## Sprint Goals

1. Develop a functional prototype of the Customer Segmentation Engine
2. Integrate the segmentation system with existing data collection infrastructure
3. Implement initial clustering algorithms for basic customer categorization
4. Create testing framework with sample customer data
5. Establish baseline metrics for measuring segmentation effectiveness

## Sprint Parameters

- **Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks (10 working days, 8 hours each)
- **Team Size**: 4 developers
- **Required Allocation**: 80%-100% per developer (64-80 hours per developer)
- **Total Sprint Capacity**: 256-320 hours

## Hours Allocation

| Developer | Issues | Total Hours | % Allocation |
|-----------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Developer 1 | #1, #6, #11, #13 | 76 | 95% |
| Developer 2 | #2, #7, #10 | 64 | 80% |
| Developer 3 | #3, #5, #9, #15 | 80 | 100% |
| Developer 4 | #4, #8, #12, #14 | 80 | 100% |
| **Total** | | **300** | |

## Sprint Architecture

The Customer Segmentation Engine will be built as a modular system with these key components:

1. **Data Integration Layer**: Connects to customer data sources
2. **Feature Engineering Module**: Transforms raw data into meaningful features
3. **Clustering Engine**: Implements algorithms to identify customer segments
4. **Persistence Layer**: Stores segmentation results and history
5. **API Layer**: Provides interfaces for other systems to access segments
6. **Visualization Components**: Displays segment information for marketing teams

## Dependencies

- Task #5 depends on completion of Task #3
- Tasks #8 and #12 depend on basic implementation of Task #5
- Task #14 depends on completion of Tasks #4, #5, #8, and #10

## Definition of Done for Sprint

The sprint will be considered successful when:

- All 15 tasks meet their individual definitions of done
- The segmentation engine can process sample customer data and generate meaningful segments
- Marketing team can visualize and understand customer segments
- API endpoints allow other systems to access segmentation data
- All tests pass with at least 90% code coverage
- Documentation is complete and approved by stakeholders
